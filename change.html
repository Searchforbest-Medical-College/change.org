 <span> #MUST #READ #BOLLYWOOD #NEPOTISM #KILLS #TALENT.!</span><br><br>

We the people want to collectively raise our voice against the practice of nepotism in the Indian cinema (“Bollywood”), which has increasingly become a brutal reality. Bollywood is not an oligarchy (ruled by the few) but is a democracy. In this petition, we ask popular streaming companies such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hot star to immediately stop promoting movies generated by the above mentioned media houses. These are not movies, these are platforms to launch children of famous movie stars. These are not movies, there is evidence that nepotism is running rampant in the industry. 

 

In February 2020, a credible source shared that the “the mafia” has decided to boycott the young actor Sushant Sigh Rajput. He mentioned that given this new reality for the brilliant actor, he will have to go back to TV to make a living.

The environment created by the owners of these companies and their allies has isolated young talented actors, robbed them of opportunities and significantly compromised their DREAMS. We have strong reason to believe that this possibly led one very special actor to take his life this Sunday June 14, 2020. His name was Sushant Singh Rajput (SSR). We CANNOT let this happen again. We must Stop the Bullying and Support Struggling Actors.
As a physics Olympiad winner and an engineering school topper, Sushant Singh Rajput was a brilliant student. He was also a brilliant actor. Rooted in humble beginnings, he lost his mother at the age of 16. He was passionate about acting and left school to become an actor and starting from scratch as a background dancer. At the age of 34 his dream of acting in this industry came to an untimely and tragic end. Watch any interview, you will see that he was a sweet, sensitive soul. He so wanted to be part of bollywood.
